# Genetic Algorithm

> Genetic algorithms are **population based search algorithms** to solve combinatorial optimization problems. It was first proposed by John Holland (1989). They generate solutions for optimization problem **based on theory of evolution** using concepts such as
**reproduction, crossover and mutation**. The fundamental concept of a genetic algorithm states a set of conditions to achieve global optima.

## Genetic Algorithms to solve Multiobjective Optimization problem

> ... In traditional single-objective GA approach
to solve multiobjective problems, **we can combine the individual objective functions into
a single composite function by weighting the objectives with a weight vector**. Another
approach is to **make most of the objectives as varying constraints and optimize just the
main objective**. Both these approaches **require multiple runs to generate Pareto-optimal
solutions consecutively**. But the ability of GA to simultaneously search different regions
of a solution space makes it possible for a generic **single-objective GA** to be **modified
into a multiobjective GA** to find a set of **Pareto optimal solutions in one run**. In addition,
most multiobjective GAs do **not require** the user to **prioritize, scale, or weight objectives**.
Therefore, GAs is one of the most frequently used metaheuristics to solve multiobjective
optimization problems. In fact, 70% of the metaheuristics approaches used to solve
multiobjective optimization problems uses genetic algorithms (2002b).
