# Genetic Algorithm

> Genetic algorithms are **population based search algorithms** to solve combinatorial optimization problems. It was first proposed by John Holland (1989). They generate solutions for optimization problem **based on theory of evolution** using concepts such as
**reproduction, crossover and mutation**. The fundamental concept of a genetic algorithm states a set of conditions to achieve global optima.
