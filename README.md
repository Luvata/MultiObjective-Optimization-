# MultiObjective-Optimization

This project is my write-up about solving a MultiObjective Optimization problem with Genetic Algorithms.
## Objective 
An algorithm to evaluate and select top 3 students from a list of student to form a team.
Information is the result of each student when taken a same amount of problems in a period of time.

## Todo
- [x] Make a github project and write down some early knowledge 
- [ ] Make todos ( on planning )
- [ ] Simple GA project with single objective
- [ ] Simple GA project with multi objectives
- [ ] ...
